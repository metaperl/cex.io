| You buy 1g Au      | 0-6% comm.      | n/a           | n/a      | n/a  |
| Downline* buys 1g  | n/a             | perhaps       | n/a      | 1 unit     |
| You buy a package  | n/a             | n/a           | n/a      | n/a        |
| Downline* buys pkg | 0-6% comm.      | perhaps       | 5-20%    | 40e - 80e  |
